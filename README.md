# Snow-Common

Snow-Common, or libsnow-common, is essentially a collection of commonly-used
classes, functions, and other code for the Snow engine. It covers maths, some
data handling (the Sparse C++ implementation), and other common utilities and
structures that have utility across multiple projects (including sbfgen, Snow,
and a few other projects).

## License

Except where noted otherwise, all source code in Snow-Common is public
domain. You are free to do with it as you like on the condition that you are not
a dick. I cannot enforce this condition, so it's meaningless and still public
domain.

See COPYING for further details.

## Exceptions to The Public Domain License

Current exceptions to public domain-ness in Snow-Common are:
